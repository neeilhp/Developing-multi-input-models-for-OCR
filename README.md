# Developing-multi-input-models-for-OCR
DigiNsure Inc. is digitizing old insurance claim documents by training an OCR model that uses both images and insurance types (home, life, auto, health, or other) to identify primary and secondary IDs. This approach aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of processing claims by combining image and text data.
